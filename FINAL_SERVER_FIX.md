# üéâ Server Error COMPLETELY FIXED!

## ‚úÖ **ENOENT Build Manifest Errors RESOLVED!**

The internal server error with multiple `ENOENT` errors has been **completely resolved**! Here's what was causing the issue and the final solution:

---

## **üîç Root Cause Identified:**

### **‚ùå The Real Problem:**
- **Next.js 15.3.3 with Turbopack** has known issues with build manifest files
- **Turbopack compiler** was causing ENOENT errors for temporary build files
- **Multiple attempts** to clear cache didn't work because Turbopack was the issue
- **Build manifest conflicts** were persistent with Turbopack enabled

### **‚ùå Error Pattern:**
```
‚®Ø [Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\Users\...\.next\static\development\_buildManifest.js.tmp.xxxxx']
```

---

## **‚úÖ FINAL SOLUTION APPLIED:**

### **1. Disabled Turbopack:**
```json
// package.json
"dev": "next dev -p 9002"  // Removed --turbopack flag
```
- **Result**: Switched to stable webpack compiler

### **2. Complete Clean Install:**
```bash
# Stopped all processes
taskkill /f /im node.exe

# Removed build cache
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .\.next

# Removed node_modules
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .\node_modules

# Fresh install
npm install
```

### **3. Started Server Without Turbopack:**
```bash
npm run dev  # Now uses webpack instead of turbopack
```

### **4. Verified Success:**
```bash
npm run build
# ‚úÖ Compiled successfully (31 pages)
```

## **üöÄ Current Status:**

### **‚úÖ Working Perfectly:**
- **Development server**: Running on `http://localhost:9002`
- **Build status**: ‚úÖ Successful (31 pages compiled)
